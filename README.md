Unreal Engine 4 Basic Game - Movable Character with Physics and Animation
This project demonstrates a movable character created in Unreal Engine 4, showcasing physics-based movement and animations. It leverages C++ programming and the OOP principles to simulate realistic interactions in a 3D space.

Features:
Character Movement:

Designed a fully controllable character capable of moving forward, backward, left, and right.
Implemented jumping mechanics to allow the character to move vertically (up and down).
Physics Integration:

Integrated collision handling for smooth interaction with the environment.

Utilized MIXAMO animation presets to map actions like walking, running, and jumping to the characterâ€™s movements.
Synchronized animations with character actions for a seamless gameplay experience.
Technology Stack:
Engine: Unreal Engine 4
Programming Language: C++ (Object-Oriented Programming principles)
Animation Presets: MIXAMO
Physics: Built-in Unreal Engine physics libraries for collisions and dynamic interactions
Highlights:
This project serves as an excellent example of combining Unreal Engine 4's capabilities with custom C++ logic to create dynamic gameplay. It's a foundation for expanding into more complex games involving advanced character behaviors and environments.
